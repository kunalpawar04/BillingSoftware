# Billing Software

A full-stack **Billing Software Application** built with **Spring Boot (Java)** on the backend and **React** on the frontend.  
The system allows customers to create accounts, purchase items across categories, and pay using an integrated payment gateway or cash on delivery.  

It also provides secure authentication using JWT and role-based access for **Admin** users.
